         <h2>  There's a truth not many know, 
            <p> About the world while you're asleep: </p>  </h2>  
         </div>

            <div>
            
            <h2>   <p>That the wind slips through your window, </p>
             <p>To seal the secrets that you keep,</p>
            <p>And if you don't believe me,</p>   </h2>  
         
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>    <p>Then you're welcome to your doubt,</p>
            <p>But have you never stopped to wonder,</p>   </h2>

       <div>
       <h2>      <p>What it's whispering about?</p>
      <p>What else in the world,</p>   </h2>  </div>

       <div>
       <h2>   <p>Could make the treetops bend and sway,</p>
         <p>But the weight of all the words,</p>   </h2>  
</div>
       <div>
        <h2>     <p>That no one everdared to say?</p>
    <p>And since it's while you're sleeping</p>   </h2>  
    </div>
<div>
    <h2>    <p>Secrets are easiest to take</p>
     <p>It's no surprise those with the deepest,</p> </h2>
